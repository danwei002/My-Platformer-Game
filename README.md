# My-Platformer-Game
A Super Mario inspired platformer game that I created for my Grade 11 Computer Science course. The game was created in Greenfoot, coded entirely in Java.
It is a non-scrolling platformer game consisting of six unique levels designed by myself. The objective of the game is to reach a flag positioned somewhere
within each level. The player controls a small Mario sprite that moves around the level. He is capable of walking, sprinting, and jumping to 
traverse each level.
